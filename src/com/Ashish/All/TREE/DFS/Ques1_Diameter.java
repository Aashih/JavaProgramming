//https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/
//this question is very simple
//we just use the height of the binary tree algo(Jo terko ata ho ni ata to gaand maara )
//and take a variable dai(initally 0) and add the height of right and left after every recursion call also add 1 in this(left+right+1)
// then put the max of dia
//after that return Math.max(leftHeight,RightHeight) + 1;
