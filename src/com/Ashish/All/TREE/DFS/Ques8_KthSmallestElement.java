//In this question in order traversal is used - Because we know
//in BST if we want to find the samllest element we have to use inOrder traversal

//just do one thing take a cont variable which counts the smallest item
//(initially 0)
// then do inorder traversal ;
//if count == k  then we found our our answer just return from there
//otherwise call right subtree
